Do you think violence in movies is something that should be taken seriously, or do you think children are fine with a bit of light exposure?", "The movie has some great actors like Joe Pesci doing slapstick violence as well.  I think a small amount of violence can be acceptable to children but the context is most important. I don't think I was negatively affected either watching certain shows. Murder, rape, and beating spouses or children could have an effect on children. In the case of this movie, it is criminals so like a giant game of mouse trap hit a new obstacle in every room. This is like stranger things were things are going to jump out. It is like a train accident and you can't look away seeing what is about to happen.", "That sounds like a fun movie.

Wow, that is a very large family, I can see how they forgot one family member. Do you think their family is too big? Do you prefer a small family or a large family?", "I think that is too large of a family. I only have one sibling. I understand why people like to have large families because they are never alone and have a large support base. How about you? Any preference on family size?", "I also have only one sibling, and I think it was a good size. Small enough to feel important, but you wouldn't feel lonely.

I think movies with cliffhangers are okay, but not very necessary. I do think that sequels can be positive, since we often get attached to a character and enjoy watching that character develop. That reminds of super hero movies these days. Do you think they have too many movies in succession?", "I think some of the super hero movies are coming out too fast. The first home alone move is the best of the three. It is funny that Trump is in the 2nd movie and gives back directions to Kevin at his hotel in New York.", "Oh wow, that is funny.

I don't know about that, but I think that Agent Phil has always been one of the coolest characters in the movie series. ", "I think it showed that he was a trustworthy character. The F-22s brought the movie into the real world and real worl dmilitary.  Phil is one of my favorite characters to. The agents of SHIELD seem to hold together the Marvel universe.

What about you?", "Yes Lindsay Lohan really played her role well to show how social cliques are bad in society.", "This movie was highly praised by critics. Do you usually like to see movies with high ratings?", "Yeah, I remember the Rolling Stones called it comic gold. I love high ratings for a movie, but there are some good ones with low ratings. Even this movie has Metacritic score of 66/100 but I think it should be higher. What else did you like about it?", "I enjoyed that it dealt with the serious topic of female high school cliques through comedy. I thought Tina Fey adapted Rosalind Wiseman's book \"Queen Bees and Wannabes\" well into a film. Do you generally like comedies?", "The social cliques damage girls and that is why it was referred to as a \"knockout.\" It even made  one of the top 50 greatest teen comedies Comedies are great, especially this one. The reference to the clique girls as Plastics makes me laugh Did you know it got a cinema score of A-?", "Haha yeah, hearing Jan and Damian describe the Plastics to Cady was great.  Wow, that's a good score. It seems like CinemaScore appreciated having the great team of Lindsay Lohan, Tina Fey, and Mark Waters together.", "When Cady joins the Plastics, Janis plots revenge because she is excluded and uses Cady as ammo. Who else is your favorite character?", "I liked Janis because she started plotting against the Plastics and welcomed Cady when she arrived. Regina is interesting too because she's the most popular. Why do you think the Plastics invited Cady to sit with them at lunch?", "Rachel McAdams as Regina George complemented the role played by Lindsay Lohan, Cady because she plays queen bee real well. I think she invited Cady to sit with them to smell the roses and see if Cady was Plastics material, outside appearance having already qualified.  What is another scene you like?", "Oh yes I think you're right. I liked the scene where Principal Duvall called all the girls into the gym to settle the problems caused by the Burn Book. Could you believe that Janis actually confronted Regina?", "Janis must have been fueled by rage because she defied Ms. Norbury. Really tragic when Regina storms out and is hit by a bus, breaking her spine. The director crippled her, indicating cliques cripple everyone involved what do you think? There may even be a hidden warning about the dangers of attending a public school; suggesting cliques are a public school occurrence? Do you see any hidden messages in key scenes?", "Wow, I hadn't thought of it like that! Yeah the clique destroyed the relationships between the students with the teachers and each other, and having Regina get hit by a bus was a great way to illustrate that point.  Hmmm even when Janis stands up to Regina Cady still tries to apologize. I think that shows that Cady still sees Regina as a predator or alpha/queen of the school, maybe a reference to the animal kingdom since her parents are zoologists. I bet it was hard for Cady to integrate into public school since she'd been homeschooled. What role do you think Janis and Damian represent in the movie?", "Is it me or is screenwriter Tina Fey playing with the image of Regina George, as suburban public schooled Barbie, polar opposite of Legally Blonde character as ethical and beautiful ? Janis and Damian represent the outcasts hanging on the fringe. Cady recognizes everyone wants to belong when she breaks her plastic tiara and passes out the pieces after saying everyone of her classmates is special in their own way. She acts as the bridge between the oucasts and the clique members. Cady may represent confident, but not over confident like the Plastics or underconfident like the outcasts, what do you think?", "I actually haven't seen Legally Blonde, but if Regina is the end product of public school cliques then definitely not a positive image. I think that made the contrast even stronger when Cade reverted to her old personality and joined the Mathletes", "I agree, but the change in her may have been brought about by a desire to belong. This desire to belong, Tina Fey may be suggesting is dangerous. ", "Yeah, Cady really connected everyone together in the end. Maybe Tina Fey was commenting that someone inside a situation can't see how destructive it is, and it really takes an outside perspective to fix things.", "You know the book is based on Rosalind Wiseman's self help book Queen Bees and Wannabes Interesting point about Cady highlighting damaging effects of cliques for girls", "Ok, so even though Cady bridged everyone together she was also human and susceptible to the social desire to belong. That must be a theme of the book Do you think Cady joined the culture in the end after changing it, or always remained a little bit of an outsider?", "Girls are typically social and emotional creatures, she even reconciles with everyone and makes peace. I think Cady remained an island unto herself like Switzerland that was neutral but could communicate with both, because she \"reaches a truce\"; neither an outsider nor an insider because she rejected the rules they had in place before.", "Yeah I think she probably learned a lot from the experience, and changed everyone else as well.

That wouldn't be good at all for me I would be so mad.", "I know, right? At that point, I felt sorry for Kate as well. Then on top of that, you can only land a flight to Scranton and while there, all flights to Chicago were booked. Talk about stressful!", "For sure very stressful. I wonder what the family was thinking back in Paris at the apartment of Kevin's Uncle.", "Their vacation was certainly ruined while Kevin was in the process of rigging up their house with booby traps for Harry and Marv! That was a hilarious scene as well!", "Kevin was a kid genius. Rigging up the house like mini macgyver. Of course seeing Marv and Harry get tricked was very funny. Thank god Marley got there before Kevin got hurt.", "You're right! Thankfully he did get there just in time and the cops came shortly after to arrest Harry and Marv!", "I love seeing the whole family reunited at the end. Having Kevin realize he didn't want his family to go away was very touching.", "It was - especially after he sees the family was still gone on Christmas day at first before Kate entered the house calling for him.", "I do find it a little interesting that no one informed the family about the events that took place while they were gone.

Does bruce wayne's cave get cooler?", "Well, there are two major things. One of which only becomes clear in hindsight and with reflection.\n\nBatman is a very reactionary storyline. It's about a rich guy who decides to take out his anxieties by taking the law into his own hands beating up criminals. Which is... very close to a troublesome narrative, but whatever. And in Bale's vision, this reactionary thread gets even stronger. It's a very right-wing film series, which doesn't much thrill me.", "Does the movie have the original batman theme song?", "The other thing is Bale's performance, which I keep hinting at. He plays Bruce Wayne as a fairly generic, blank figure -- not unlike American Psycho. You can tell there's something a little bit wrong under the surface, but his social mask is just... Mr. Bland Rich. As Batman, though, he lowers his voice and grumbles so much that you can't make out a word he's saying. It plays almost like he's sending it up.", "Do you think Christan Bale will ever do stuff on youtube with Ice Poseidon?", "I don't actually recall much about the Bat-Cave, or the set design, except for Gotham at large -- which is very cool, in how it's portrayed.

He got so much hype just because of Titanic. It was interesting to see him in a role like this though- playing the bad guy instead of the hero.", "True! I like when actors such as that change roles. In the movie were you able to follow the scenes ok or did you get lost. Such as when they entered Fischer's subconscious and were attacked by guards?", "I got so lost in this movie- not gonna lie. It was hard to keep up with the plot twists! When Fischer (the younger)\n got abducted and they took him into that shared dream that was a little confusing. ", "Yes agreed. I had to keep asking what part of the dream are they in. It kept changing. Then it became apparent he was stuck in some type of limbo. ", "The part where Cobb says that dying would normally wake them up in real life was very strange. And the whole concept of dream limbo was bizarre! The writers were definitely imaginative.

I started to think I should take notes to keep up.", "Yes notes would be helpful!! And then when Cobb says they spent 50 years in dream world but it was only a few hours of real life, that was crazy. It took a really dark turn when Mal committ\ned suicide though.", "Yes I was just about to say this. So basically now the dream world is longer than reality and they have a totem to help them distinguish between whats real and not real. What a turn of events. Only the suicide backfires because Cobb leaves his kids and flees the country. ", "Yeah learning about the totems was another \"wait what's going on?\" moment! Do you think Cobb was responsible for Mal's \ndeath?", "No, it seemed like she woke up and still thought she was dreaming so she did that to wake him up. Not sure how the totem did not work or why she thought that. ", "That part was a little confusing to me, too.  Is it a movie you'd go see again?", "True. I am still trying to figure out exactly how she framed him. Probably not. It was too much. Too much concentration.", "Yeah that didn't make sense. How could she frame him if she killed herself? He definitely felt guilty over her death though. ", "Which is weird to me. Why did he feel guilty. He didn't kill her and why was her projection still projecting if she was dead.", "Right? So many questions. And then how did Cobb end up in Limbo again? ", "Haha I know. Do you remember the end. Where he does the test to prove he's not in the dream world anymore with the spinning top. He ignored it. So was he in limbo still or reality?", "That part was very strange! I think he was in Limbo still... I think the result showed him he wasn\nt in reality and he chose to ignore it because he didn't want to face reality.", "Yea, then it got me wondering if he was dead too or something. the whole moving was frustrating.
