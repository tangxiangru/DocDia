It felt less serious and much more fun than other superhero movies.", "I find it interesting that critics say Terrence Howard's character plays a man who looks dispirited and taken for granted. Normally he plays the tough guy in movies. Do you believe the fact that he is slightly depressed and taken for granted can be a direct subliminal message as to how our military solider/veterans are normally treated in today's society?", "Yeah compared to his newer roles this was definitely one of the more unique ones in the sense that he was taken for granted. I think what you're saying about the possible hidden messages behind his character could definitely be true as the film has a lot of characters like that such as Shaun Toub. I agree with the critics that Gwyneth Paltrow's performance couldn't really be expressed due to her role and the lack of expansion to her character.", "Exactly, judging from the document, it kind of feels like Shaun's played a very important factor in creating the first Iron man suit, but he is not given recognition as one of the inventors. In fact I think he created the most important part of the sure. Without the electromagnet he created, Start would probably be dead. In this sense I would say that actually makes him the hero in the story. Normally that is how it is with her being a supporting character. There are only a few instances where the love interest in the story get's the attention she deserves.", "I agree that especially during the time it was released the CGI was amazing and had a very noticeable attention to detail during the action sequences when it was truly shown off.", "On another note, I would definitely agree with the critics in regards to it seeming like a military thriller. Normally those types of moves give you a sense of American pride or are extreme tear jerkers. So i can definitely see why there is a feel of depressing and going through the motions. I find it interesting that his character is primarily portrayed as a war hero. Although he is a mythical character, I think the director does a great job with releasing this movie in 2008, shortly after the war ended in Afghanistan in real life. This makes the viewer connect to the story line in more present day realistic struggles/issues. Interesting", "I could totally see and agree with the statement it acts as a military thriller in the first half, especially during the key scene where when he is testing a new type of missile from his company in Afghanistan his convoy is ambushed and he is taken captive by a group of terrorists.", "In your opinion was Robert Downey Jr a great fit to play this role?", "His performance of a wild and egotistical playboy was very spot on and amazing to watch play out on the screen, out of all the performances he definitely is the most memorable of all of them. His performance made me feel like his character would realistically approach problems with the solutions they actually provided on the screen, and that he reacts to people and events in a way that you'd imagine Tony Stark to react.", "That's interesting. Looking at the ratings. I would definitely go see this movie. Rotten Tomato critics are tough and this movie has a 94% average. Definitely seems to be a must see.", "While I liked the scene where he eliminates the terrorist threat from Gulmira in memory of Yinsen, I feel like his discovery of Stane's evil plot and him asking Pepper to \"hack\" into their own company' company's database was a little bit weird considering he is the CEO. I also thought it weird he didn't bother to report it to any authorities and Pepper decided to take action and call SHIELD.", "Yes Marvel movies normally has a weird way to introduce new information in their scenes. They often contain plot twists and \"wow\" moments which keeps fans entertained. I'm glad he saved the village but I was very surprised to find out about Stane's true identity.", "I don't really understand Stane's motives necessarily either, he is a vice president at one of largest and most powerful weapons defense companies in the world and without a doubt makes large sums of money, but he feels the need to sell arms on the side to terrorists in a third world country? I'm certain that isn't exactly super profitable. On the grand scale of movie villains especially Marvel villains, Stane seems rather cheesy and uninspired and I think that's one thing they could have definitely improved on.", "Yes he as portrayed as evil and motivated by monetary gain. But of course every story has to have an antagonist when we are taking about Marvel.  I agree his role could have been developed better. Maybe his character was created to simply capitalize Stark's capability to succeed in those types of situations.", "Another thing I think this scene and the entire movie failed to utilize was the agency of SHIELD, Pepper simply alerts an agent of Stane's evil activities but we don't really see them try to find a solution or stop the activities and let Tony handle it.", "I'm not seeing much information about Pepper, except the fact that she discovered the truth about Stane. I would think there would be like a rescue scene or something with her, or more interest placed on their love connection.  Great point! I strongly dislike when movies introduce information without resolution. Fans hate leaving with unaswered questions.", "Pepper eventually accompanies a few SHIELD agents to one of the Stark buildings due to her all-access pass, and you could argue when they are eventually taken out and Pepper is left that Stark coming in at that time was her rescue scene. I think later on in the scene Pepper turns it into less of a rescue scene and more of a duo fighting against Stane when she proves her worth managing to overload the reactor of the building and killing Stane in the process.", "I think the scene where Stark defeats Shane would have the audience on the edge of their seats. But i definitely think the producers did a great job making Stark the hero because It's impressive for a hero to still conquer without his  suit at full capacity.", "I think they added that part where he isn't at full capacity to show that it's not just the suit doing all the work but the heroic actions and confidence of the person using it."], "docId": 21, "whoSawDoc": 3}

Like the actors?", "depends if you like Christian Bale, Katie Holmes, Liam Neeson Michael Caine or Gay Oldman all great actors and if you've ever seen Christian Bale in American Psycho then i really suggest it because the way he portrays himself in that movie to the people he must interact vs. the way his mind really functions is almost similar to Batman from the way he must play the part of the suave and well mannered businessman during the day and to the eye of the public but then to shift almost into an entirely different person when he becomes batman who is both vengeful and yet righteous it's fascinating", "that does sound fascinating It is always better when you have great actors Is there a strong female actor? Or is the focus on batman?", "yep, in my personal opinion, the best actors are Liam Neeson, Micheal Caine, and Gary Oldman, i'm such huge fans of their work. Especially Gary Oldman when he plays Dracula in the 1992 Bram Stoker's Dracula which also has Keanu Reeves and Wi\nnona Ryder The movie is more focused on batman\nb ut there are a few moments where Katie holmes proves her strong side in her determination to bring down criminals the legal way", "Thats great Is there any comments about the movie you would like to share?", "none that i can think of, i think i'm satisfied in the points i've made", "Thank you.

So then I tend to agree with his defense lawyer - that he\u2019s seen as callous and uncaring, which makes him pretty a unsympathetic character.

How are the characters in La La Land different from the norm?", "One of the main characters is Ryan Gosling and the other is Emma Stone.

I've never seen Gosling in a musical but this movie is worth watching because I like  to hear piano coupled with a jazz genre. ", "Oh awesome, I love that style!  I had no idea that both Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone could sing.  Is the whole film done in a jazz genre?", "The jazz genre is the theme of the movie but this film is the never ending quest to make it big in Los Angeles. The two lead characters of course end up working together, fall in love and the movie shows their ups and downs within their lifestyle and personal lives. I think this movie comes out a little unrealistic but it allows us to dream a bit and enjoying the musical aspect of it", "What do you feel is unrealistic about it?  What kinds of ups and downs do they go through?  The theme is interesting; it's typical of anyone trying to make it in show business, and of course gives more fuel for songs.", "The unrealism stems from dance halls from the past that don't exist now except in the movie. It is entertaining though because of the musical aspect of it all. We can only imagine things happening that are within the movie with the struggling actors. As with any movie one has to like the actors to be able to enjoy the moments that seem to sag a little. This movie may give rise to the resurgence of musicals back into the movie mainstream. Do you think that might happen?", "So are the dance halls in the movie treated as though they really exist, or are they parts of a set the characters are working on while trying to make it big in LA?  Music does tie everything together, that is very true.  What kinds of struggles do they go through?  I think that musicals can make a comeback depending on the scenes, plot, and type of music.", "These dance halls are created for movie effects but they are the mainstay for the main characters trying to break into stardom within Hollywood. The struggles are related to the type of music that they like but getting the directions attention is another story altogether. Do you like it when musicals turn into some sort of dancing theme as well?", "Oh I see, so they are sort of the window onto the struggles the characters are having, with music and with their private lives, it seems.  I do enjoy musicals with dancing; I think it adds interest and liveliness.  Is there a lot of dancing in this film? And what types of dancing are there?", "There isn't as much dancing as there is singing within the film. It seems that the main characer is trying to save the genre of the music he loves from going away from popularity. That music is themed to the black musical genre that is so pedominant in the Southern States. Do you treasure movies with more emphasis on singng or dancing to make it enjoyable for you to watch?", "Does the film give a reason as to why the genre he loves is becoming less popular?  Is it because it is primarily only popular in that location in the US?  I like movies with singing or movies with dancing, or some combination of both, actually.  What kind of dancing is done in La La Land?", "Yeah the type of dancing that is done in the movie seems to be done only in a movie setting. In real life, well it's probably just not done but enjoyable to watch.There are moments within the movie where the main character talks about the dying art of the music that he loves but still supports it. Do you think that movies and real life musicals are still a fantasy?", "What kind of dancing is only done in a movie?  There are lots of genres of dancing that I've seen done in real life too, so I'm having a hard time picturing the style of dance in La La Land.  What art is dying?", "Since I don't dance at all it's hard for me to depict the type of dance that is in the movie. Whether it's in the movies or not, dancing is a foreign skill to me. I know that dances have style names to it but which ones I do not know. Are you versed in the different types of dancing? That is, do you enjoy dancing with different dance styles?", "I do enjoy different types of dance, yes.  I would venture to guess that the dance in this movie is jazz dancing maybe.  Is it described at all in any manner?  Is it fast dancing or slow dancing?  ", "In my vernacular it would be considered Hollywood dancing. But all this is secondary to the main theme of trying to \"make it\" in Hollywood while romancing each other. A musical romance movie made for the masses. It sounds like your interest is piqued for this movie? Is it?", "Hollywood dancing is probably a combination of a bunch of styles.  I think my interest is piqued, yes, but I'm curious to know more about how they're trying to make it in show business.", "I think this is a movie where you would go in with no expectations except to be entertained. There is so much drama with the news these days that I think we all need a break from reality. We need just to enjoy some light hearted movie that is good to relax and fantasize a bit. Wouldn't you agree?", "I agree, that if it is a movie that's relaxing but has some good music and dancing, then it sounds like something I would enjoy, for sure.  What time period does the movie take place in?", "The movie depicts the most recent time period as in today's environment. Which is why it is a bit of a fantasy. But I think the lead actors Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone can save the day with this movie by keeping this type of genre alive in the consumers quest for entertainment.", "Ah, which is why you think the dance halls didn't fit because they're way older in history.  I agree that they are both good actors, and I'm surprised to find them acting in a musical...pleasantly surprised.  Does the movie end happily ever after, so to speak?", "The movie ends only with the thought that good things can happen with the right attitude and chemistry between people. Keeping the dream alive with hope and inspiration can be tough but so very desirable. This is a movie where people will just want to lsiten to the music and forget the plot altogether. Do you watch movies over again just to watch the actors? I believe this type of movie with its musical aspects is that type of movie that needs repeating.", "I do watch movies over again if I want to see particular scenes for enjoyment or study.

There were some interesting characters in this movie. What character did you relate to most?", "Leonardo DiCaprio was compelling in the role of Dom.  The Inception seems like a tailor fit role for DiCaprio.  I enjoyed his performance but found that the plot was so inventive that I had a hard time relating directly to any of the characters.  It seemed too divorced from reality. Did this movie make you ponder the origins of your own thoughts?", "Well, it was interesting, to say the least.

Do you think it would be worth\n the potential setback?", "I think that possibility is much greater than a setback.  I took it to mean that all the extractors as well as the subject would be trapped forever.  In that way it seems much too risky.

If there was an alternate reality available that was more enjoyable I could see where Mal would want to believe it was the \"real\" reality.

I'm growing older right now but I believe this is reality.  I'd certainly be happy to die, but then wake up a younger man!

What about the music score, do you know if the music score is by someone well-known or relatively unknown?", "Yes, Harry Styles used to be a part of One Direction but I think he left the group and went solo.  Unfortunately there is no mention of the music score or who made it.  However, it mentions the cinematographer was Hoyte van Hoytema.", "Okay, yes, that's the Harry I've heard of. I didn't realize he'd gone into acting, but sounds like he made a good choice from the way the critics have responded to the movie. I'm interested in seeing this movie because I know very little about the British side when they were in France. I wasn't even aware of a place called Dunkirk until now.

Next, a hospital ship gets sunk and then a destroyer is blown up by a torpedo from a German U-Boat.  There definitely sounds like a lot of dramatic moments happen in this movie.", "Oh, I like a movie that gets moving right away. It sounds like Dunkirk does just that most definitely. I can almost picture it in my mind. With a hospital ship getting sunk, it would really tug at my emotions right off the bat as well. It does sound very dramatic the way it begins.", "The action continues in the next scene.  The Britist navy has to resort to collecting civilian boats to rescue people, and the main characters, Alex and Tommy, have to hide out in a trawler (small boat) in order to avoid being shot at by the Germans.

A lot of attacks by the Germans continue throughout the first couple scenes.", "It sounds like a lot of action and drama combined. I think I'd be on the edge of my seat the whole time. The thought of the emotions the scenes would stir up is pretty heavy, especially the Germans shooting at the boat just for target practice.", "Yeah that really shows how outnumbered the Allied forces are if the German are just shooting at random boats for target practice.  Clearly they have plenty of ammunition and a strong presence near the beach.  After that boat sinks, Alex and Tommy swim toward a destroyer but it gets sunk by a bomber. Eventually they are rescued again, but it seems like every attempt they make to get to safety is thwarted by the Germans.\n ", "With things going the way they are for Alex and Tommy, the ending seems pretty unpredictable to me, especially with it being about the war and the different way this movie is said to be done overall. ", "I agree.  I'm unsure how many causalities occurred during the Battle of Dunkirk, but Tommy is described as the only survivor of a German ambush who was able to retreat to the beach.  There are thousands of Allied forces awaiting evacuation, so it was clearly a slaughter if they had no choice but to evacuate all together. \n ", "I am shocked I've never learned of this before, but very glad that it was made into a movie, at least. To be the only survivor of the Battle of Dunkirk, it's really hard to imagine all of the mixed emotions that the real Tommy must have felt. This sort of movie really sounds like a movie well worth watching.", "Oh no, he wasn't the only survivor of the entire battle.  His squad was ambushed and he was the only one who survived and escaped it.  In the next scene, Commander Bolton confirms that 300,000 soldiers had to be evacuated, ten times what was expected.  Apparently they intended to create a stronghold in Dunkirk, but were outnumbered and had no choice but the evacuate or lose even more soldiers.", "Oh! Okay, I understand. Still, having your whole squad killed, that's pretty awful anyway. I imagine he must've suffered survivor's guilt, it is so tragic. War is tragic, but maybe with movies like this people will appreciate peace more. Having to evacuate 10 times more soldiers than anticipated is incredible, as Commander Bolton had to do. I imagine that was such an undertaking, and that the movie would show a lot of dramatic action scenes in covering it.", "Definitely.  Fortunately Alex and Tommy are evacuated and return to Britain safely where they are welcomed by the citizens in a town called Woking.
