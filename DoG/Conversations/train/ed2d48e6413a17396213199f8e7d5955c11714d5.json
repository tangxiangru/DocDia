I didn\u2019t go into them because they could be considered spoilers, but since the film has been released, I\u2019ll go into what they are. The first is the way the movie begins. The movie essentially has three prologues: Diana at the Louvre, Diana as a child, and the story of how the Amazonians came to be. It\u2019s all necessary exposition, and director Patty Jenkins handles it wonderfully. The movie never feels like it\u2019s dragging, and you become more invested in Diana\u2019s world the more you learn.\n\nMy other concern was Ares. While on the edit bay visit we were told that David Thewlis was playing a British politician named Sir Patrick Morgan, word had leaked that he was actually Ares. I was worried that this was an unnecessary twist since Morgan\u2019s job\u2014advocating for the armistice\u2014would seem to be at cross-purposes with Ares\u2019 true goal, which is perpetual war.",

      "text": "Wonder Woman is a 2017 American superhero film based on the DC Comics character of the same name, distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. It is the fourth installment in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). The film is directed by Patty Jenkins, with a screenplay by Allan Heinberg, from a story by Heinberg, Zack Snyder, and Jason Fuchs, and stars Gal Gadot as Diana Prince / Wonder Woman, alongside Chris Pine, Robin Wright, Danny Huston, David Thewlis, Connie Nielsen, and Elena Anaya. Wonder Woman is the second live action theatrical film featuring the titular character, following her debut in 2016's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.[5] Jenkins's role as director makes her the first female director of a live-action, theatrically released comic book superhero film.[6] The film tells the story of Diana Prince, who grows up on the Amazon island of Themyscira. After American pilot Steve Trevor (Pine) crashes offshore of the island and is rescued by her, he tells the Amazons about the ongoing World War. Diana then leaves her home in order to end the conflict.\n\nWhile development for the film began in 1996, Jenkins signed on to direct in 2015. Principal photography began on November 21, 2015, with filming taking place in the United Kingdom, France, and Italy before wrapping up on May 9, 2016, the 123rd anniversary of the birth of the creator, William Moulton Marston. Additional filming took place in November 2016.\n\nWonder Woman premiered in Shanghai on May 15, 2017, and was released in the United States on June 2, 2017, in 2D, 3D and IMAX 3D. It received largely positive reviews from critics, with praise for its performances (particularly those of Gadot and Pine), direction, action sequences, and musical score.[7] The film set numerous box office records;[8] it is the fifth-highest-grossing superhero film domestically and 20th-highest-grossing film in the United States. It grossed over $821 million worldwide, making it the tenth highest-grossing film of 2017. It also helped the DCEU to push past $3 billion at the worldwide box office, making it the fourteenth-highest-grossing film franchise of all time. As of October 2017, Rotten Tomatoes has listed the movie as No. 1 on its list of the \"50 Best Superhero Movies of All Time\",[9][note 1] and the American Film Institute selected it as one of the top 10 Movies of the Year.[10] The film received three nominations at the 23rd Critics' Choice Awards, winning Best Action Movie. A sequel is set to be released on November 1, 2019 with Jenkins and Gadot reprising their roles as director and lead role respectively",
