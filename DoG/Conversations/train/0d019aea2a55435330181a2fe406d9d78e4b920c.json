At each\ndream level, the person generating the dream stays behind to set up a \"kick\" that will be\nused to awaken the other sleeping team members from the deeper dream level; to be\nsuccessful, these kicks must occur simultaneously at each dream level, a fact complicated\ndue to the nature of time which flows much faster in each successive level. The first level is\nYusuf's dream of a rainy Los Angeles. The team abducts Fischer, but they are attacked by\narmed projections from Fischer's subconscious, which has been specifically trained to\ndefend him against such intruders. The team takes Fischer and a wounded Saito to a\nwarehouse, where Cobb reveals that while dying in the dream would normally wake Saito\nup, the powerful sedatives needed to stabilize the multi-level dream will instead send a\ndying dreamer into \"limbo\", a world of infinite subconscious from which escape is extremely\ndifficult, if not almost impossible, and a dreamer risks forgetting they are in a dream.\nDespite these setbacks, the team continues with the mission.\n\n2. Cobb reveals to Ariadne that he and Mal went to Limbo while experimenting with the dream-\nsharing technology. Sedated for a few hours of real time, they spent fifty years in a dream\n\nconstructing a world from their shared memories. When Mal refused to return to reality,\nCobb used a rudimentary form of inception by reactivating her totem (an object dreamers\nuse to distinguish dreams from reality) and reminding her subconscious that their world was\nnot real. However, when she woke up, Mal still believed that she was dreaming. In an\nattempt to \"wake up\" for real, Mal committed suicide and framed Cobb for her death to force\nhim to do the same. Facing a murder charge, Cobb fled the U.S., leaving his children in the\ncare of Professor Miles.\n3. Through his confession, Cobb makes peace with his guilt over Mal's death. Ariadne kills\nMal's projection and wakes Fischer up with a kick. Revived at the mountain hospital,\nFischer enters a safe room to discover and accept the planted idea: a projection of his dying\nfather telling him to be his own man. While Cobb remains in Limbo to search for Saito, the\nother team members ride the synchronized kicks back to reality. Cobb eventually finds an\naged Saito in Limbo and reminds him of their agreement. The dreamers all awake on the\nplane and Saito makes a phone call.\nUpon arrival at Los Angeles Airport, Cobb passes the U.S. immigration checkpoint and\nProfessor Miles accompanies him to his home. Using his totem\u2014a spinning top that spins\nindefinitely in a dream world but falls over in reality\u2014Cobb conducts a test to prove that he\nis indeed in the real world, but he ignores its result and instead joins his children in the\ngarden.",
