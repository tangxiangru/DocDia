Later, Gru contacts Perkins via video chat, stating\nthat he finally has the shrink ray. Margo, Edith, and Agnes interrupt the meeting, and\nPerkins announces that he has lost confidence in Gru and will no longer fund his\noperations. As Gru tells the Minions he can no longer pay them for their services, the girls\noffer the contents of their piggy bank. Gru, inspired, sells parts of his lair to construct a\nspacecraft. Gru plans to steal the Moon when it is nearest the Earth, but this is the same\nday as the girls' ballet recital. Gru becomes conflicted, and Dr. Nefario, seeing the recital as\ninterfering with the plan, arranges for the girls to be returned to the orphanage. At the same\ntime, Perkins informs Vector, revealed to be Perkins' son, of Gru's possession of the shrink\nray and the adoption of the three girls, encouraging Vector to act. ",
