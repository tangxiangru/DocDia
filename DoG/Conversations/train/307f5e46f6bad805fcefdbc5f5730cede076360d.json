One day Wick goes to the gas station in his hot rod mustang and these guys approach him to buy his car. He denies them which they get pretty upset. Long story short they come to his house at night and steal his car and kill the dog in front of him. The rest is about vengeance on the people who happen to be related to the mob. The fighting styles and shooting techniques are all very realistic. ",
