The directorial debut of John Lasseter, Toy\nStory was the first feature-length computer-animated film and the first feature film produced by\nPixar. Taking place in a world where anthropomorphic toys pretend to be lifeless whenever\nhumans are present, the film's plot focuses on the relationship between Woody, an old-fashioned\npullstring cowboy doll (voiced by Tom Hanks), and Buzz Lightyear, an astronaut action figure\n(voiced by Tim Allen), as they evolve from rivals competing for the affections of Andy, their owner,\nto friends who work together to be reunited with Andy as his family prepares to move to a new\nhome. The screenplay was written by Joss Whedon, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen and Alec\nSokolow, based on a story by Lasseter, Pete Docter, Stanton and Joe Ranft. The film features\nmusic by Randy Newman, and was executive-produced by Steve Jobs and Edwin Catmull.",
