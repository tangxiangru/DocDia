    "feedback": "My partner obviously did not speak english at all. I tried to keep it going but at the end he just flaked. Sorry if that messes up your data . I was going to abort but he ended the task before I could. You will notice that the only relevant answer I got from them was a poorly copied sentence from the document you provided.\n\nI liked the hit. It would pay well under normal circumstance but I think you should add a US qual or a NO IN qual that way only people who speak english will be able to accept the task. This happens a lot where workers from India try to use google translate as a alternative to actually understanding the conversation. \n\nThank you for posting a good HIT and for the chance to work on it.
