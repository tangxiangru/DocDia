Once they did give some information it sounded like it might be worth checking out.  I would likely wait until someone I knew watched it before I watched it myself.  The plot dealing with steel and gangs is nothing new, but if it is done well it could be an exciting movie.  I am not a fan of the main actor mentioned, Jackman, so this would be the main reason for my lack of interest in watching it.  Also the setting would have been more interesting if it were set in the past, when the steel industry was much bigger.  ",
