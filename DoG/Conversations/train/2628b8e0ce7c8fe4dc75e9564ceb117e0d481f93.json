I think people either fell in love with the world of these characters, in which case they were probably more impressed by the partying than the downfall, or they saw these characters for the delusional people they were and had a hard time getting through the film. That probably explains its middling reviews. It's cinemascore is a C. For a Scorcese film, that seems a bit low.",
