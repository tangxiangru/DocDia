At each\ndream level, the person generating the dream stays behind to set up a \"kick\" that will be\nused to awaken the other sleeping team members from the deeper dream level; to be\nsuccessful, these kicks must occur simultaneously at each dream level, a fact complicated\ndue to the nature of time which flows much faster in each successive level. The first level is\nYusuf's dream of a rainy Los Angeles. The team abducts Fischer, but they are attacked by\narmed projections from Fischer's subconscious, which has been specifically trained to\ndefend him against such intruders. The team takes Fischer and a wounded Saito to a\nwarehouse, where Cobb reveals that while dying in the dream would normally wake Saito\nup, the powerful sedatives needed to stabilize the multi-level dream will instead send a\ndying dreamer into \"limbo\", a world of infinite subconscious from which escape is extremely\ndifficult, if not almost impossible, and a dreamer risks forgetting they are in a dream.\nDespite these setbacks, the team continues with the mission.",
