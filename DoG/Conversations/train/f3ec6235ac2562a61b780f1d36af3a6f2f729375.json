While the stories of it malfunctioning are legendary, it is completely believable and terrifying onscreen. The climax, where the shark and Roy Schieder battle to the death, is utterly dependent on the creature's effectiveness and it delivers. While Steven Spielberg hid the shark until the climax, Bob Mattey's monster lives up to the film's build up by being as scary as we were told it would be up to that point.\u201d",
