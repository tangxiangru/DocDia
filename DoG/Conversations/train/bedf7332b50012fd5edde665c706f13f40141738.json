The music for the film was composed by Randy Newman, marking his seventh\ncollaboration with Pixar. It was the fourteenth feature film produced by Pixar, and is a prequel to\n2001's Monsters, Inc., marking the first time Pixar has made a prequel film.[7] Monsters University\ntells the story of two monsters, Mike and Sulley, and their time studying at college, where they\nstart off as rivals, but slowly become best friends. John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi,\nBob Peterson, and John Ratzenberger reprise their roles as James P. Sullivan, Mike Wazowski,\nRandall Boggs, Roz, and the Abominable Snowman, respectively. Bonnie Hunt, who played Ms.\nFlint in the first film, voices Mike's grade school teacher Ms. Karen Graves.",
