It tells the back story of Bruce Wayne's side and journey from when his parents died to him becoming batman and his motives behind the creation of the Cape Crusader. It really lets you dive in to the psychological side of what Bruce believed and how he saw life after he lost his parents while at the same side trying not only to help gotham become the city he once thought it was but to also avenge and rebuilt the Wayne name in his parents vision for them to make Gotham City a better place. It also lets you see the light and dark side behind his mind and the villians who try to teach him even the best people can have the darkest intentions",
