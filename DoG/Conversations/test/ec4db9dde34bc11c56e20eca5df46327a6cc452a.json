Dunkirk portrays the evacuation from three perspectives: land,\nsea, and air. It has little dialogue, since Nolan sought to create suspense from cinematography\nand music. Filming began in May 2016 in Dunkirk and ended that September in Los Angeles,\nwhen post-production began. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot the film on IMAX 65 mm\nand 65 mm large format film stock. Dunkirk has extensive practical effects, using thousands of\nextras, boats that participated in the evacuation, and period aeroplanes.",
