The basic\nmethod of the firm is a pump and dump scam. To cloak this, Jordan gives the firm the\nrespectable-sounding name of Stratton Oakmont. After an expos\u00e9 in Forbes, hundreds of\nambitious young financiers flock to his company. Jordan becomes immensely successful\nand slides into a decadent lifestyle full of prostitutes and drugs. He has an affair with a\nwoman named Naomi Lapaglia. When his wife finds out, they divorce, and he marries\nNaomi. Meanwhile, the SEC and the FBI begin investigating Stratton Oakmont. Jordan\nillegally makes $22 million in three hours upon securing the IPO of Steve Madden. This\nbrings him and his firm to the attention of the FBI. To hide his money, Jordan opens a Swiss\nbank account with corrupt banker Jean-Jacques Saurel in the name of Naomi's Aunt Emma,\nwho is a British national and thus outside the reach of American authorities. He uses the\nwife and in-laws of his friend Brad Bodnick, who have European passports, to smuggle the\ncash into Switzerland.\n1 In 1987, Jordan Belfort procures a job as a Wall Street stockbroker for L.F. Rothschild,\nemployed under Mark Hanna, who quickly entices him with the sex and drugs fueled\nstockbroker culture and teaches him that a stockbroker's only job is to make money for\nhimself. Jordan soon finds his career terminated following Black Monday and takes a job at\na boiler room brokerage firm on Long Island that specializes in penny stocks. Thanks to his\naggressive pitching style and the high commissions, Jordan makes a small fortune.",
