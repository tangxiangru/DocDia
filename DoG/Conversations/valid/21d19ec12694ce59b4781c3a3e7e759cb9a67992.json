He/she explained \"Batman Begins\" perfectly, and since I haven't watched the film, my interest was piqued. I will definitely watch it now. I had a great time and I will be glad to participate in more of these. I hope my re-entering of the conversation due to the first user leaving early does not put me in trouble.
